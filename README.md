# Email_Classification
## Supervised Classification Pipeline to Classify Emails as Spam or Non-spam
This project aims to build a supervised classification pipeline to classify emails as spam or non-spam. The dataset used for this project is the Enron email dataset, which is a collection of public domain emails from the Enron corporation. The dataset contains manually classified emails as spam and non-spam. The primary goal of the project is to create a model that can accurately classify emails based on their content.
## Dataset

The Enron email dataset is used for this project. The dataset can be accessed from the following URL: [Enron Email Dataset](https://www2.aueb.gr/users/ion/data/enron-spam/). It consists of a collection of emails from the Enron corporation, with each email labeled as spam or non-spam.
## Code

The project code is written in Python and utilizes various libraries and techniques for data analysis, preprocessing, and modeling. 
The necessary libraries for data analysis, visualization, and model building include libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and NLTK.

## Usage

To use this code, follow these steps:

    - Download the Enron email dataset from the provided URL.
    - Set up a Python environment with the required libraries (NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, etc.).
    - Copy the code into a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script.
    - Update the file paths in the code to point to the downloaded dataset.
    - Run the code step by step or execute the entire code at once.

Make sure to have a good understanding of the code and adjust it as needed for your specific use case.
